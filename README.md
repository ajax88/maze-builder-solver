## This project is a mazebuilder/mazesolver written in c.
### Created by Alex Jackson: 11/7/15

#### Includes a 2-D unboxed array abstraction that is used to interpret the maze.

This program creates a randomly generated m x n (m and n are inputs from the user) maze and outputs 
the result. The user can then solve the maze and has the option to use the solver to generate the correct solution. 

Try it out!
